# January 2023 update

# The main objective for the program is to automate the addition of flights to an existing spreadsheet.
# Previously, there were nine fields to be filled out per observation:
# * Date (if none, current datetime date entered)
# * Airline (if applicable)
# * Flight # (if applicable)
# * Aircraft type (required)
# * Origin IATA code
# * Origin Country
# * Destination IATA code
# * Destination Country
# * Direction

# With this program, we will scrape the FlightAware API to see if there are any new transatlantic flights to add.
# If there are no flights to add, the program exits and nothing changes.
# If there are flights to add, it will format them properly by:

# * Reducing the departure/arrival times to strf dates
# * Splitting the ICAO identifier into an Airline and Flight # (if applicable)
# * Recording aircraft type
# * Converting ICAO codes to IATA codes via dictionary
# * Adding origin and destination countries (derived from IATA codes via dictionary)
# * Direction based on origin country (e.g. If flight in US, it's "E" for East; otherwise, "W" for West.)
# In the interest of cardinality, we have also added an ID field to provide a primary key.

# A couple of housekeeping items. We are using Eastern Time, and the list of columns below are relevant for the use of
# airline and aircraft dictionaries.
