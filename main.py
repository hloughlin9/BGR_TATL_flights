# The main objective for the program is to automate the addition of flights to an existing spreadsheet.
# Previously, there were nine (reduced to seven with datetime and ML, respectively) fields that had to be filled out per observation:
# 
# 	# Date (if none, current datetime date entered)
# 	# Airline (if applicable)
#	# Flight # (if applicable)
# 	# Aircraft type (required)
# 	# Origin IATA code
# 	# Origin Country
# 	# Destination IATA code
# 	# Destination Country
# 	# Direction (predicted by ML)
# 
# With this program, we will scrape the FlightAware API to see if there are any new transatlantic flights to add to our spreadsheet.
# If there are no flights to add, the program exits and nothing changes.
# If there are flights to add, it will format them properly by (future plans after "EVENTUALLY" if applicable):
#    	
# 	# Reducing the departure/arrival times to strf dates
#	# Splitting the ICAO identifier into an Airline and Flight # (if applicable)
#  	# Recording aircraft type
#  	# Converting ICAO codes to IATA codes via dictionary
# 	# Adding origin and destination countries (derived from IATA codes via dictionary)
# 	# Predicting direction based on origin country (e.g. If flight originates in USA, it's "E" for East; otherwise, "W" for West.)
#
#   # In the interest of cardinality, we have also added an ID field to provide a singular field that can function as a primary key.
